## What is Intic.id?

Our mission is to revolutionize the event industry by providing transparent, secure, and fraud-proof ticketing through NFT technology while empowering both event organizers and attendees with decentralized finance features and community governance.

---

## The Problem We Solve

The traditional event ticketing industry faces significant challenges that impact both organizers and attendees:

### Ticket Fraud & Scalping
Users face constant threats from counterfeit tickets and unauthorized resellers who exploit pricing, making authentic tickets difficult to obtain at fair prices.

### High Platform Fees
Centralized ticketing platforms charge exorbitant fees (often 15-30% per transaction), eating into both organizers' revenue and attendees' budgets.

### Lack of Transparency
Traditional ticketing systems operate as black boxes, making it impossible to verify ticket authenticity, track secondary sales, or ensure fair distribution.

### Limited Control for Organizers
Event creators have minimal control over ticket resales, receive no royalties from secondary markets, and struggle with fraud detection and attendance verification.

### Complicated Refund Processes
Attendees face lengthy, bureaucratic refund processes with no protection against fraudulent event organizers who may disappear with funds.

### No Ownership or Rewards
After events end, tickets lose all value and become mere memories, with no ongoing engagement or rewards for loyal attendees.

---

## Our Solution

Intic.id addresses these challenges with a comprehensive blockchain-powered platform:

### **NFT-Based Ticketing**
Every ticket is minted as a unique NFT on the blockchain, providing verifiable proof of ownership and eliminating the possibility of counterfeit tickets. Each ticket becomes a permanent, collectible digital asset.

### **Transparent Marketplace**
Our decentralized marketplace enables peer-to-peer ticket trading with complete transparency. All transactions are recorded on-chain, ensuring fair pricing and providing event organizers with automatic royalties from resales.

### **Smart Contract Automation**
Automated smart contracts handle ticket sales, distribution, refunds, and check-ins without intermediaries, reducing fees to just 2.5% compared to traditional platforms' 15-30% fees.

### **Fraud Protection System (V3.1)**
Our advanced fraud protection includes:
- **72-Hour Withdrawal Lock**: Organizers cannot withdraw funds immediately after events, preventing exit scams
- **Community Reporting**: When 30% of attendees report fraud, emergency refunds are automatically triggered
- **Used Ticket Refunds**: Attendees can get refunds even for used tickets if fraud is detected
- **NFT Burn Mechanism**: Refunded tickets are permanently removed from circulation

### **Instant Check-In Verification**
QR code-based check-ins with blockchain verification ensure real-time attendance tracking and eliminate duplicate entry attempts.

### **Community Governance**
Token holders participate in platform decisions through decentralized governance, ensuring the platform evolves according to community needs.

### **Universal Chain & Wallet Integration**
Leveraging PushChain's groundbreaking **Universal Chain Architecture** and account abstraction technology, users can:
- Create wallets instantly without seed phrases or complex setup
- Purchase tickets from any supported blockchain (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.)
- Hold and manage tickets across multiple chains in a single unified interface
